Description:

My project is an online Address Book. It allows to store and retrieve the contacts(Name, Phone No, Email, Birth Day of people you know ect). There are two types of access to this Address Book 

1)Admin
2)User 

Admin can add, delete, view all contacts, search for a contact and sort them on first name.
Users can only view them. Both admin and user will be provided with username and password to have access the Address Book.

Usage Instructions: 

User can use the username and password provided to him to access the addressbook.
For proper functioning of the project, user should not enter the information containing '~' and '|'.
